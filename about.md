Our Values, when operating with us and being with us
- Professionalism: In general, a professional is expected to have a formal qualification and a higher performance than an amateur. A professional is said to have professional qualities such as accuracy, thoughtful actions, formal execution reporting, etc. A person is expected to have an increased level of knowledge, skills, and abilities, a particular problem-solving ability. A professional can foresee consequences of professional activities ( "A professional knows what he's doing.") and the ability to reject tasks that cannot be processed with sufficient quality. 
- Speed: Speed is one of the differentiation factors in our company. We strive not only to respond to requests and agreed activities of customers quickly and in a timely manner, but also to live internally. This is done in the awareness that each individual, by his fast and professional work, keeps the costs and efforts of the "other side" low, because WAITING means costs.
- Integrity: Personal integrity is the consistent maintenance of the personal value system with one's own actions. In the enterprise, that means sincerity, striving for justice, trustworthiness. An integral person lives in the awareness that his personal beliefs, standards, and values expressing his behavior. Integrity is something a person is partly responsible for. On the other hand, integrity depends on the well-being of fellow human beings and on the social conditions of life. The statement about individuals - they are "integrity" - means that these people are "incorruptible" and have "solid, deep-rooted, positive values" to which they stand and from which they can not be dissuaded.
- Openness: people with a lot of openness are characterized by adjectives as imaginative, original, inventive, imaginative, intellectually curious, open to new ideas, sensitive to own and foreign emotions, willing to question traditional values
- Reliability: All stand for each other and help each other. 
- Consistency: All individual processes and activities, the occurrence of which is inherent in a regularity, are provided just as professionally.
